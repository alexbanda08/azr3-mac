# Rumpelrausch TÃ¤ips' AZR-3 Mac OS X Port
Mac OS X port of Rumpelrausch's classical drawbar organ VST instrument.

## About

AZR-3 is an emulation of a drawbar organ providing two keyboards and a pedal section. The VST is very well optimized for CPU usage (specially for nowadays standards) also being very light (3.4 MB) and having great, persistent sound quality.

It's not a close tonewheel emulation, but you can choose between different basic waveforms in addition to the "clean" sound of pure sine waves.
